# Lessons Learned

## Branching

- **Auto-named worktree branches:** workspace tooling may check out a prefixed branch (e.g. `superset/develop`). Ignore it — switch to the plain branch the user names (`git switch -c develop --track origin/develop`), commit and push only there, and delete the prefixed local branch. Never push the prefixed branch.
